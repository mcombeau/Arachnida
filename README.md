# Arachnida

A 42 school cybersecurity bootcamp project to create two programs:

- Spider: an image web scrapper,
- Scorpion: an image EXIF and metadata viewer/deleter.

## Spider

Spider is a small python script that scrapes a URL to download the images within. It can be launched in recursive mode, to follow internal links to a certain depth and download images from there as well. It complies with the website's `robot.txt` directives.

## Scorpion

Scorpion is a small python script that displays an image's metadata. It can also be used to create a copy of the image, stripped of all of its exif data.
